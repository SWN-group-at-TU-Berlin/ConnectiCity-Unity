# ConnectiCity-Unity
 Welcome to ConnectiCity, the serious game that teaches you about climate-resilient cities and inter-connected critical infrastructures!

ConnectiCity is an innovative and engaging game designed for students to learn about the challenges faced by modern cities and how to address them. In the game, you'll be tasked with developing a new neighborhood in the city, while also protecting it from flash floods with the use of Blue-Green Infrastructures (BGIs) and managing traffic with strategically placed bus stops.

With ConnectiCity, you'll learn about the importance of creating resilient cities that can withstand the effects of climate change. You'll also learn about the interconnectedness of critical infrastructures and how they impact our daily lives.

As a project-oriented towards education, ConnectiCity provides a fun and interactive way for students to learn about urban planning, sustainability, and the importance of resilient infrastructure.

Our game is built using Unity, ensuring a solid and interesting experience for players. ConnectiCity is also open-source, so you can contribute to its development and make it even better!

Join us on this exciting journey towards creating more resilient and sustainable cities. Play ConnectiCity today!
